  <h1>North American Aves</h1>
  <h5>
    Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, 
    characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, 
    a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.

        <h3>Bald Eagle</h3>
        <p>
          A bald eagle's white head may make it look bald. 
          But actually the name comes from an old English word, "balde," meaning white. 
          These graceful birds have been the national symbol of the United States since 1782.

        <h3>American Robin</h3>
        <p>
          The American robin is a migratory bird of the true thrush genus and Turdidae, the wider thrush family. 
          It is named after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, 
          though the two species are not closely related, 
          with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family.
